<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOW_THE_RENT_WAS_PAID">HOW THE RENT WAS PAID</h2>
</div>


<p>She was about 25, well dressed, neat in appearance,
rather good looking, quite intelligent,
and a teacher of art. The distressed look upon
her face when she entered my office showed that
she was undergoing terrible suffering of some
kind. She greeted me with the inquiry, “What
in the world will I do, doctor?”</p>

<p>I told her the first thing she should do was
to sit down, just get quiet a little and “let go,”
then tell me all about it.</p>

<p>I talked with her about unimportant matters
for a few minutes until I saw that she
had grown somewhat calm and quiet in the harmonious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
atmosphere of my office and then asked
her what her trouble was.</p>

<p>She said that it was money or rather the
lack of it. I told her there was plenty of
money in the world and a great abundance of
it right here in New York. “Yes,” she said,
“but I can’t get hold of it unless I pawn my
diamond ring. I had to pawn one of them last
month in order to pay my rent and will have
to pawn my last one in order to pay my rent
this month and then what shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Why pawn your ring now?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I haven’t pawned it yet,” she said, “but I
will have to do so.”</p>

<p>“You may not as yet have gone through the
physical act of taking your ring to the pawn
shop and leaving it there,” I replied, “but
you have pawned it already in your consciousness,
your thought world, your imagination,
and unless you at once stop pawning it there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
you will soon take it to the pawn shop. But
should it be necessary for you to go to the
pawn shop, why worry about it? Why not
look upon your rings as cash in the bank, to be
drawn upon when necessary. We sometimes
draw our bank balance down to the last dollar
but that does not worry us for we know we will
deposit some more right away, and when we do
KNOW it we always get the money to deposit.
Why not take this same attitude towards the
ring you have in pawn?”</p>

<p>“Again, this is only Friday and the first of
the month does not come until next Monday,”
I said. “Supposing you did not pay your rent
on that day your landlord would not put you
out for you have always been a good tenant and
paid your rent heretofore. Even though he
was to serve a dispossess notice on you you have
five days in which to pay or move, so that you
have at least a week from to-day, under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
most unfavorable conditions, in which to get
your rent money.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, “that is all very true but
from whence is the money coming? I haven’t
been doing any work lately and no one is paying
out any money for my kind of work these
days and I haven’t a cent in sight anywhere and
no place I can go to get any, except by pawning
my diamond ring, even if I had two months’
time instead of only a week.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t necessary for you to know from
whence the money is coming,” I replied, “for
that is the work of God—the great Universal
Law. <em>Your</em> work is to KNOW that God always
attends to his part of the business and
materializes things for us, both in body and
environment, to accord with the vision or image
we create and hold in our imagination and the
harmonious or inharmonious energy we use in
creating and holding it. God always does his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
part of the work whether we do ours consciously
and intelligently or unconsciously and
ignorantly. Just so long as you hold the
image, thought or idea that you will have
to pawn your ring, creating and holding
this image, thought or idea in fear and
trembling, then the only thing God can do
for you is to work out that image in material
form the same as he did for you last month.
You actually had to pawn your ring then,
and while you paid your rent, yet you are in
even worse condition to-day than you were then.
You can continue to do this same thing again
this month and keep it up until there is nothing
left for God to do for you but to continue
materializing lack and inharmony for you in
every way. Or by using this same Universal
Law which has brought you lack, but changing
your application of it by changing the image,
thought, idea, vision with which you fill your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
imagination, you can attract the money to
you with which to pay your rent, get it in a
perfectly legitimate and constructive manner
and not have to pawn your ring either, and by
continuing to make the new application which
I will teach you you can be in a much better
position this time next month instead of a
worse one as you now are.”</p>

<p>“Oh how can I do it, doctor,” she asked.</p>

<p>“Just FILL your thought world, your imagination,
with the thought, idea, image, vision,
that you have your rent money NOW, and keep
it FILLED. Every time the thought of lack
comes to you displace it at once with the affirmative
statement of ‘I have the rent money
NOW,’” I replied.</p>

<p>“How can I say ‘I have the rent money
NOW,’ doctor,” she asked, “when I know it’s
a lie, for I haven’t it?”</p>

<p>“My dear girl,” I said, “as long as you know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
you haven’t it; as long as you know it’s a lie,
just so long will you continue to be without it,
for God—the Universal Law—can only materialize
for you according to your vision and the
energy back of it, and he cannot furnish you
with supply for your needs so long as you continue
to create lack, fear, worry, anxiety, etc.,
in your consciousness, your imagination. When
you learn to affirm that you have your rent
money NOW with one-tenth the energy and
creative power you use in affirming its lack,
God will materialize it for you.”</p>

<p>“Well, doctor, I will try,” she said.</p>

<p>“That will not do,” I answered.</p>

<p>“I will do the best I can, then,” she said.</p>

<p>“That will not do,” again I answered.</p>

<p>“I will do it,” she said.</p>

<p>“Now I <em>am sure</em> you will succeed,” I replied.</p>

<p>On the following Tuesday she came into my
office with her face wreathed in smiles and, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
greeting me, said, “Oh doctor, it is so wonderful.
I hardly know how it was done, but it
seemed as though every one in the world
wanted to pay me money since I was here the
other day, and I have collected enough money
not only to pay my rent this month but was
able to take my ring out of pawn to-day.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_WORLDS_INJUSTICE">THE WORLD’S INJUSTICE</h2>
</div>


<p>She was of medium height and so thin she
could scarcely make a respectable shadow. Her
well worn but not shabby dress, and her flimsy
jacket told a story of lack in environment
which her peaked, bloodless face and emaciated
body showed in the latter.</p>

<p>She had been a room clerk in one of New
York City’s big skyscraper hotels. Worked
twelve hours, then had six hours off; worked
six hours and then had twelve hours off. This
was her ceaseless grind of work day after day
and night after night, with never a Sunday nor
holiday off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>In the course of her work she was brought
into contact with both guests of the hotel and
the hotel employees. She was the meeting point,
as it were, for the complaints, irritations and
annoyances of the former and the excuses and
counter-charges of the latter. Her position
was not a sinecure by any means as you may
well imagine.</p>

<p>She never had been very strong and after
playing the “buffer” between guests and employees
for a couple of years, her nervous system
was so worn out that she decided to quit her
position and obtain something not so hard or
trying on her.</p>

<p>She succeeded in securing a position as
demonstrator in a department store for some
new invention where she worked only half of
each day and received six dollars a week for her
services.</p>

<p>She found that department store customers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
were not made of any different material than
were hotel guests and the constant irritations
which came up in her dealings with the public
continued to wear on her over-wrought nervous
system to such an extent that night after night
she would go to her room without any dinner,
throw herself on her couch without removing
any of her clothing, not even her hat, and lie
there all night long, too exhausted to undress
and go to bed.</p>

<p>This condition had been going on for several
months when she first came to see me.</p>

<p>I saw at once that her trouble was not with
her work but in the way she had been doing it—the
attitude she had taken towards the people,
things, and conditions with which she contacted.
She had been resenting and resisting the “injustice
of the world,” of people and things.
The great injustice which compelled her to
labor when she was not able to work, and which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
only enabled her to eke out the barest kind of
an existence; the injustice which prevented her
from having friends, going to entertainments,
dances, etc., and from enjoying life as did other
girls. Her whole thought world was filled
with a bitter and resentful condemnation
and criticism of the “world’s injustice” to
people in general and to herself in particular.</p>

<p>She never once realized, much less thought,
that she herself had set all of the causes in
motion which brought this condition into her
life and that she was still setting the causes
in motion which would continue it until she
learned her lesson and her own power of creation.</p>

<p>When I told her this she would not believe
it at first, it was such a new idea to her, but
it set her to thinking and she came back a few
days later and said she had decided to place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
herself entirely in my hands and would follow
my instructions to the very last letter. There
was no hope for her in any other way that she
could see and so she had decided that my instructions
could not produce any worse conditions
for her than already existed while there
was a promise of the possibility of something
better.</p>

<p>I told her the first thing she was to do was to
relax and “let go.” That she was so tense and
resistant she repelled everything which was at
all constructive and harmonious. With each
breath she inhaled she was to make the following
affirmation: “I am breathing in the Peace
and Harmony of God’s Universe NOW.” Peace
and Harmony are manifestations of the Universal
energy the same as are heat, light, air,
etc., and the more she could realize this Truth
and so create the consciousness that she really
was breathing in the Peace and Harmony, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
more would she relate with and attract them to
her.</p>

<p>It was necessary for her breathing and affirming
to be done without strain, effort, or tenseness,
as anything which required strain, effort
or tenseness lost its value the moment this was
begun. Her entire trouble was not so much in
the work she had been doing but rather <em>in the
way she had been doing it</em>, and when she developed
the habit—the consciousness—of doing
her work without resentment or resistance—that
is without strain, effort or tenseness—did
it because she loved it and it was a “blessed
privilege” for her to do it—all her tired, nervous
condition would disappear entirely and
she would become strong, healthy and well.</p>

<p>This result would not be obtained in a day
or two, or with only breathing and affirming a
few times each day but that it would be necessary
for her to “make a business” of it and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
breathe and affirm many times each day, do this
just as often as she could possibly take the time
to do it. She should devote as much time each
morning and evening to the breathing and affirming
as she could without getting the consciousness
or feeling that it was work and that
she had to do it, for that meant strain, effort
and tenseness, but she should develop the <em>want
to love to do it because it was the highest, greatest
and best thing she knew how to do</em>; that she
should keep on doing this without paying any
attention to the results she obtained.</p>

<p>When we are all the time “looking for results”
it shows a consciousness of doubt and
fear, and it is this state of consciousness which
always delays the materialization of constructive
results because it makes for destructive
ones.</p>

<p>During the day she was to take one or two
deep breaths and make the affirmation as frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
as she could think of it, even when she
was attending to a customer, and that in accordance
with the persistency and harmony
with which she followed these instructions would
her old conditions disappear and more harmonious
ones gradually take their place.</p>

<p>How well she followed these instructions is
evidenced by the fact that in less than a month’s
time she had a good appetite, enjoyed spending
her evenings in social intercourse, slept well
every night, and arose each morning full of life
and ambition.</p>

<p>She began to see that what she had thought
was the “world’s injustice” was only the effects
of the causes which she herself had ignorantly
and unconsciously set in motion through the
destructive thoughts she had allowed to persist,
and she learned through applying the lessons
to her own life which I had taught her that
there was no injustice in the Universal Law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>To-day she is a well woman and has a home of
her own where she cares for those who, like herself
of former years, need the instruction and
care I gave to her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BETRAYING_ONES_CONFIDENCE">BETRAYING ONE’S CONFIDENCE</h2>
</div>


<p>“Once I betrayed the confidence of a very
dear friend, afterward doing everything in my
power to regain the friendship, love, and confidence,
but the injury seemed too deep for forgiveness.
Now what shall I do next?”</p>

<p>This is an inquiry which I recently received
and contains a problem that affects many lives.</p>

<p>This man said that he did “everything in my
power to regain the friendship, love, and confidence.”
I have no doubt but what that is
true in so far as his knowledge goes as to what
was in his “power to do,” but he made the same
mistake that the world always makes and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
is he did all of his work in attempting to influence
and control the other party.</p>

<p>Let us first understand that it is impossible
for one person to either betray another’s confidence
or injure him in any way. The careless
and indifferent thinker will at once say that
this is not true. I do not intend to argue the
question, for my work is not to either proselyte
or convert, but rather it is to teach, and so
it does not make any difference to me as to
whether any one agrees with me or not.</p>

<p>No one is asked to blindly accept any statement
I may make, but the one who really wants
to learn will accept “on probation” such statements
as are not as yet truth to him, and then
test them out for himself in every way he may
wish until, through his own experience, he is able
to see their truth and accept them because he
has proved them for himself and not because I
have made them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>It is true that we often <em>seem</em> to betray
another’s confidence or <em>seem</em> to injure some one
else, but we do not do this in reality, we only
<em>seem</em> to do it simply because we have not gone
deeply enough into the study of life to understand
the Law of Cause and Effect and the
instruments which are used by God—the great
Universal Law—in working out the effects of
causes man sets in motion.</p>

<p>We can and do betray our own confidence
and inflict serious injuries upon ourselves again
and again, but <em>never</em> upon another person.</p>

<p>When we study life deeply we see the great
universal Law of Cause and Effect manifesting
everywhere and we come to understand that this
Law prevails throughout the Universe and that
back of every <em>effect</em>, no matter how trivial and
unimportant it may seem to us, lies the determining
<em>cause</em> which produced it. It is true
that this <em>cause</em> is too deeply hidden for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
superficial and unsuspecting student to observe
it but it is always there and can be found by
the soul which has the <em>real want</em> to discover it.</p>

<p>People and things are only instruments in the
hands of God—the great Universal Law—to
work out in the lives of those with whom they
contact the effects of the causes they set in
motion, and when we become convinced of this
wonderful Truth we cease to blame others for
any effect we may receive and neither do we
blame ourselves for any effect which we, as the
instrument, may give to others. Each life always
does the best it knows how at the particular
moment of the commission of any act.
Many times afterward we see that we have made
a mistake and are “sorry” for it, but it is
another mistake to be “sorry.” When we see
we have made a mistake and done what we say
is the “wrong” thing, it is because we are in
a different state of consciousness, one that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
more harmonious and constructive and where
we can see the bigger vision and larger ideal
than the one we were in at the time the “wrong”
act was committed. In the lesser state of consciousness
we were in at the time the act was
committed, that which we did was the best we
knew how to do in that thought current.</p>

<p>It can therefore be readily seen that had our
“know how” been better at that particular
moment—that is had we been in a more harmonious
and constructive state of consciousness,
or mind, or thought current at that moment—we
would not have committed the act.</p>

<p>Our work then is to so develop our human
mind that we will create within ourselves such
a harmonious and constructive state of consciousness
as will cause our “know how” to at
all times accord with our highest ideals.</p>

<p>Had the man who wrote me the inquiry at the
beginning of this letter done this he would never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
have “betrayed the confidence” of his friend,
for his “know how” would have accorded with
his highest ideals and so prevented the betrayal
when the opportunity arose. He then could
not have been used as the destructive instrument
in the life of his friend to betray the latter’s
confidence.</p>

<p>While it is true that we are only instruments
in the hands of God—the great Universal Law—to
work out in the lives of those with whom
we contact the effects of the causes they have
set in motion, it is also true that we are not
compelled to be blind, ignorant and destructive
instruments, directed and propelled by a
“fate” over which we have no control. It is for
each life to determine whether it shall be a
constructive or destructive instrument in the
hands of the Universal Law. No one else can decide
this question for us. We alone have the
power of choice. We alone are responsible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
for the effect of our decision. We can make
this decision consciously and intelligently or
unconsciously and ignorantly. We can continue
to manage our life “with eyes which do not
see and ears which do not hear” as long as we
may wish. We can remain both blind and ignorant
of the effects of the causes we are momentarily
setting in motion just as long as we
desire. God—the great Universal Law—never
steps in and interferes with our doing anything
we may desire, no matter whether its effect on
us is what we call “good” or “bad.” He always
permits us to go on, knowing that “the cure of
the thing is in the thing itself,” and that when
we have reaped enough of the effects of the
destructive causes we have set in motion we will
open our eyes to the larger truth and learn that
we alone were responsible for the cause.</p>

<p>I told this man the first thing he should do
was to begin work upon himself so that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
“know how” would better accord with his
higher ideals more of the time. He should also
quit “trying to regain the friendship, love and
confidence” of the other person and regain his
own “friendship, love and confidence” and that
until he had done this he could not expect to
have it from any one else. He should not even
be sorry nor regret what he had done, because
energy expressed as sorrow or regret was energy
used destructively, and it was the destructive
use of energy through the thoughts and emotions
we allowed to persist which made us
destructive instruments in the hands of the
Universal Law and so made it possible, in his
case, to <em>seem</em> to betray the confidence of his
friend.</p>

<p>It would have been impossible, however, for
his friend’s confidence to have been betrayed
had not such friend himself created the cause
through his own inharmonious and destructive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
use of energy by his thoughts sometime prior
to the act. That he was in no way responsible
for his friend’s creation and that had he never
lived his friend’s confidence would have been betrayed
by some one else; his friend would not
have escaped the betrayal. He was only responsible
for the fact that he was such a destructive
instrument that he could be used in this particular
case. His work was to make his life so harmonious
and constructive from now on that it
would be impossible for the Universal Law to
ever use him again as a destructive instrument.</p>

<p>This was the only way in which he could ever
“forgive” himself and when this was accomplished
he would not need to be “forgiven” by
any one else for he would only attract to himself
harmonious expressions from those with
whom he contacted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DEVELOPING_A_CONSCIOUSNESS">DEVELOPING A CONSCIOUSNESS</h2>
</div>


<p>Many times I am asked as to what is meant
by “developing a consciousness.”</p>

<p>To “develop a consciousness” of anything is
to have knowledge of it; to understand it; to
KNOW it, and to KNOW that one KNOWS it;
to make union with it; to recognize our <em>oneness</em>
with it; to know that we and the thing desired
are a part of each other.</p>

<p>Take for instance some one who has never
been taught to sew. He has no knowledge of it
and is therefore very clumsy and awkward in
the handling of a needle and thread. By persistent
training and application the intelligence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
in the cells of the fingers are taught what to do
and when the “consciousness” of how to sew
has been developed in them the fingers lose their
clumsiness and become nimble and dexterous
at the work.</p>

<p>The same is true in learning to play on the
piano or other musical instrument; in using a
typewriter, sewing machine, etc. In fact when
we attempt to do anything for the first time we
are always at a disadvantage simply because we
have not “developed a consciousness” along that
line and so do not recognize our oneness with it.</p>

<p>It is true that some persons learn to do a
thing much more quickly than do others and
so we have called them “smarter.” But this is
a mistake for no one really possesses any more
ability than does every other life; some, however,
have made better use of their power than
have others. This is true both as regards this
present life as well as in former incarnations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Should you who read this be one of those
who have been discouraged in the past because
you had to work so hard in order to learn how
to do things, just remember that you have
stored up in you all the great wonderful power
of the Universe and can learn to express it
harmoniously and constructively along any line
you may desire.</p>

<p>The first step to take is to <em>recognize</em> that this
is true; then <em>recognize</em> our union with this universal
energy. Our God-self has this recognition
in our inner consciousness and we begin to
recognize it in the human mind through constantly
affirming our oneness with it. We must
be just as persistent in doing this as we are
when we are learning to sew or to play on the
piano, and no matter how many mistakes we
may make at first, nor how little we seem to
accomplish, we want to keep everlastingly at it.</p>

<p>Many persons have the idea that it is only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
necessary to repeat an affirmation over a few
times, or to say it in a half-hearted way and
then the results they desire should manifest at
once. When they are sick they seem to think
that by saying “I am well,” or “I am not sick,”
a few times that it ought to cure them and
because it doesn’t then they get the idea that
there is no power in thought.</p>

<p>When we are sick it is because the recognition
of our oneness with health and harmony
has not been well developed, and we might as
well expect a poorly developed musician to
correctly play the masterpieces of Beethoven,
Bach, Mozart, Wagner, as to expect a poorly
developed and inharmonious health consciousness
to produce a masterpiece in the way of a
perfect physical body.</p>

<p>A poorly developed musician can, with the
aid of a good teacher and by persistent practice,
learn to play everything which has ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
been written by any of the great masters, and
so can one who has a poorly developed and inharmonious
health consciousness learn to rebuild
his physical body in such perfect health
and beauty that it will in truth become a fitting
temple in which the living God in each life may
dwell.</p>

<p>But before one can become either the great
master musician or the perfect creator of a
beautiful and harmonious physical body he
must “develop a consciousness” of his <em>oneness</em>
with whichever his ideal may be, whether of
music, health, or whatever else he may desire.</p>

<p>Whenever we really want anything our desire
always is so strong, powerful and overwhelming
that we are willing to pay the price
of persistency and application and we go after
it with all the energy we can command and work
to <em>make</em> it come to us. We strain, strive and
use every effort within our power, and when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
do succeed in getting it in this way we find the
results very unsatisfactory. This is because
the world has developed a consciousness of
force and uses force (either physical or mental,
or both) in obtaining what it wants.</p>

<p>Force creates inharmony and some day the
world will learn the great lesson that there isn’t
anything, no matter how valuable it may seem
to be nor how much we may desire it, for
which it is worth paying the price of one moment
of inharmony.</p>

<p>We should learn then to do our work of
“developing a consciousness” without worry,
anxiety, strain, effort, tenseness, friction, for
all these thoughts and emotions create inharmony.
We should learn not to fight for anything
but to build and “develop a consciousness”
of our oneness with it, creating it in this
manner in our thought world first, recognizing
that it is ours NOW (no matter how far away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
its materialization may seem to be from us)
and then do on the objective plane whatever we
think is necessary or advisable to aid us in its
materialization, but do this quietly, calmly, and
with a power which KNOWS it will succeed. Do
it because we love to do it, because it is a
“blessed privilege” for us to do it. We should
never do anything with a consciousness that it
is work or drudgery, for that kind of a consciousness
makes the doing of that particular
thing a work or drudgery to us.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_BLESSED_PRIVILEGE">A BLESSED PRIVILEGE</h2>
</div>


<p>She was a very motherly woman of about
fifty years of age who had been coming to me
for treatment on account of nervousness. She
was getting along nicely, although she had only
been under my care for about a week, when
one day she came into the office all flustrated
and in a highly excited state of mind.</p>

<p>In explaining the cause of her condition she
said she was afraid that all the good work we
had done had gone for naught and that there
was no hope for her whatever. This was because
her husband’s sister, who lived in one of
the small up-State towns, had arrived the night
before for a three weeks’ visit and that while she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
loved her sister-in-law very much, yet they
never got on very well together and this visit
meant three weeks of untold misery in trying
to please her visitor. She then unloaded into
my ears a tale of woe which took her half an
hour to relate although she talked as fast as
her tongue could rattle it off. I sat back in my
chair and listened quietly until she finished her
list of complaints and I do not think she omitted
a single one of them.</p>

<p>Although my patient was a dear woman and
would not intentionally hurt the feelings of any
one—she would much rather suffer herself than
to do that—yet I saw plainly that her attitude
towards this visit of her sister-in-law had
brought her to a condition where she would
have an attack of hysteria did it continue. The
word picture she painted of the previous visits
and the miserable times she had on those occasions
would have caused almost any one to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
believe that the sister-in-law was a demon incarnate
masquerading as a human being, instead
of being only an ordinary average woman living
in the country and who delighted in the freedom
and the fascinating sights of a large city.</p>

<p>When my patient had finished her story of
condemnation, criticism and complaints, I said:
“Is that all?”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t it enough?” she answered.</p>

<p>I told her that I thought it was and then
asked whether she wished to have the same kind
of experiences again this time.</p>

<p>“Of course not, but how can I help it?” she
replied. “My sister-in-law is here and what she
has done before she will do again, and what am
I to do?”</p>

<p>“Quit building in your thought world for a
repetition of these experiences and begin to
build for what you want instead,” I answered,
“for as long as you continue to take the attitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
you have always heretofore taken towards
these visits of your sister-in-law, and towards
what she says and does; as long as you continue
to set the causes in motion which will produce
these inharmonious and destructive effects, just
so long will you continue to be miserable and
unhappy every time your visitor comes to see
you. YOU, however, can change <em>all</em> of these
conditions and effects by <em>changing your attitude
towards them</em>, provided you have the <em>real
want</em> to do this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, doctor,” she said, “I will do anything
in the world that is possible for me to do, in
order to get rid of all the misery which these
visits have caused me in the past.”</p>

<p>“Then promise me,” I said, “that you will
follow my instructions and I will guarantee
that by the time the three weeks’ visit is up
you will tell me they have been the happiest
three weeks of your life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, could I only believe that would be possible,
doctor,” she said, “I would be so happy.”</p>

<p>“I do not ask you to believe,” I replied, “but
I do ask you to follow my instructions implicitly,
for I know what the results will be even
though you do not know at the present time.”</p>

<p>I told her the first thing she should do was
to forget her own little, petty, personal self
with all of its criticisms, condemnations and
self-pity; take her hands off her sister-in-law’s
life and permit her to enjoy herself as <em>she</em> (the
sister-in-law) wanted and that she herself was
to turn in and do everything possible to make
the visit a most pleasant one and to give her
visitor the “time of her life.” She was to
remember that her sister-in-law lived in a small
town and the visit to New York once a year
was a big event in her life; one which she
planned for and talked about for months before
she came, living in the pleasure of its anticipation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
and reveling in the joys of it after her
return home. The theaters, churches, shops,
big department stores, the crowds of people, the
illuminations on Broadway were never ending
objects of interest to one who only saw them
occasionally. That heretofore she (my patient)
had only thought of herself, the extra work,
care and bother of having some one around who
disturbed her home life, and that the time she
had spent in entertaining her visitor had been
the worst kind of drudgery to her because she
had become satiated with these things and only
went with her visitor because it was her “duty”
to do so. She should plan to go with her
visitor wherever the latter wished to go and
do the things her visitor wanted to do, not as a
“duty” she owed to the sister of her husband,
as had been the case heretofore, but <em>do it as a
“blessed privilege”</em>; do it because she herself
enjoyed giving her visitor a good time; do it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
because she derived the greatest pleasure in
doing it; do it because she got so much fun,
pleasure and enjoyment out of seeing her sister-in-law
have such a good time that she would
rather do it than not.</p>

<p>I told her that when we did anything from the
plane of consciousness where it was our “duty”
to do it, that it lost its constructive effect, for
no matter how pleasant we might seem to be on
the outside there was always the inner resentment
and resistance in our consciousness because
we felt that we just <em>had</em> to do it on account
of its being our “duty,” but that when
we changed our inner state of consciousness
through changing our attitude towards a thing
and made it our “blessed privilege” instead of
our “duty” to do it, then the whole thing
changed and what had been before drudgery
and difficult to do, became in fact a joy and
pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Objectively she was not necessarily to do
anything different in entertaining her visitor
than she had always done before but <em>she was
to do it with an entirely different consciousness,
a different thought back of it, a different purpose
or motive</em>. She was to make it her “blessed
privilege” to have her sister-in-law here with
her and was to take advantage of the opportunity
to give her the very best time possible,
and that this change of attitude on her part
would work such a transformation in her as to
seem miraculous in its results.</p>

<p>She promised faithfully to follow my instructions
and about a week later she came into the
office with her face wreathed in smiles and eyes
shining with joy and gladness. “Oh doctor,”
she said, “I could not wait any longer to see
you. I just had to come and tell you how
wonderful it all is. Why last night my sister-in-law
put her arms around my neck and kissed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
me (something she had never done before in her
life) and said she never knew before how dear
I was. Everything and even more than you
promised has come true and I never was so
happy before in all my life, and it is my ‘blessed
privilege’ to tell you this. I cannot thank you
for words are too inadequate to express my
gratitude for what you have taught me.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_TELEPHONE_BELL">THE TELEPHONE BELL</h2>
</div>


<p>Ting-a-ling-ling-ling went the telephone
bell. I was hard at work on an abstract proposition
where an interruption of my thought
meant chaos for a while. My telephone had the
habit of ringing a couple of dozen times a day
on calls which were not for me, and when I
called up central to complain about it all the
satisfaction I received was “Excuse me, please.”</p>

<p>Already my ’phone had rung a number of
times this morning, only to be met by central’s
“Excuse me, please” when I answered it, and
I was in a state of exasperation that almost
bordered on a desire to murder some one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Several times I had almost gotten to the
point in which my abstract problem seemed
to be solved. Twice, just as I was about to
grasp its solution, did the telephone bell ring
only for me to hear the old familiar “Excuse
me, please.”</p>

<p>I had complained to the management about
these mistakes, the poor service, etc. Men had
been sent to inspect my ’phone and its connections;
many parts of the ’phone had been
changed and finally an entire new instrument
had been installed, but still the irritation and
annoyance of calls not for me continued.</p>

<p>I had scolded central and given her “Hail
Columbia” many times because of her alleged
carelessness, but all to no avail, and the calls
which were not for me still kept coming and
my annoyance increased rather than diminished.
Nothing I had ever said or done and nothing
the Telephone Company seemed able to do appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
to have any effect in stopping these
calls.</p>

<p>Merrily my bell rang on from twenty to
twenty-five times a day on calls which were
mistakes. It seemed as though “Old Nick”
himself was using the telephone to see how much
he could irritate and annoy me, and here the
ting-a-ling-ling-ling of his material representative
was once more ringing in my ears and the
solution of my problem again gone glimmering.</p>

<p>Impatiently I grabbed the telephone receiver
and placed it to my ear, yelling into the transmitter
a “Hello” that for its acidity, irritability,
impatience and petulance could not be surpassed.
I resolved to give central in particular
and the Telephone Company in general such a
“jacking up” as they would never forget, should
it be another call which was not for me, and at
the same time order my ’phone taken out as it
was proving to be a greater annoyance and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
trouble than its convenience would balance or
offset.</p>

<p>No answer came to my “Hello.” I called
again and again in my impatient and irritated
state of consciousness. Finally central answered
saying, “What number, please?” It was
a new voice on my wire; a voice that was filled
with friendly feeling and good fellowship; one
that unconsciously made union with the universal
harmony and so felt only the “good” in
everything, that all my irritation, annoyance
and sarcasm at once disappeared and I replied
in a voice which was new to me so filled with
harmony were its tones, “You called me?”
“Excuse me, please,” said central, and I hung
up my receiver and sat back in my chair without
another word.</p>

<p>My ’phone did not ring any more that day,
neither did I again take up the solution
of the abstract problem on which I had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
working, for another one filled my thought
world and this is the problem and its solution.</p>

<p>“Why did my ’phone ring so many times each
day on calls which were not for me?”</p>

<p>Back of every effect lies the cause which
produces it. Back of every material thing is
the energy which creates it. Nothing happens—nothing
occurs by chance, accident or
luck, no matter how much it may seem to do
so.</p>

<p>Looking at the matter concretely of the
numerous ’phone calls I had which were not
for me, the Telephone Company was to blame,
but they had made every effort on their part
to correct the trouble and it seemed to get
worse instead of better.</p>

<p>I asked myself the question “Where did the
blame <em>rightly</em> belong? To the Telephone Company
or to myself?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>I saw that the real solution to this question
was in the abstract for before anything can
be reduced to the concrete or material side of
life it must be created first in the abstract.</p>

<p>How then could I be to blame? Through the
use I made of energy in the abstract by the
kind of thoughts and emotions I allowed to
persist in my imagination and field of consciousness.</p>

<p>I had been irritable, impatient, intolerant,
sarcastic, critical, condemnatory, not only with
the Telephone Company but more or less with
other people and things. This was using energy
inharmoniously in the abstract and there could
be only one result which was its materialization
as inharmony in the concrete, and I had been
getting that materialization in the annoyance
and irritation which so many mistakes in the
telephone calls had given me. I also saw that
was only one of the ways in which I had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
materializing concretely the energy I had been
using inharmoniously in the abstract.</p>

<p>I determined to begin work on myself at once
to change the state of consciousness in me which
had permitted this condition to arise and
demonstrate the truth or falsity of my solution
of the problem.</p>

<p>It is quite easy to make “good” resolutions,
but it is a much more difficult thing to live them
out in one’s daily life. My first attempts were
abject failures, but I refused to be discouraged
and kept working with myself each day. No
matter how many times I failed I renewed my
“good” resolutions each time and became even
more determined to carry them out. My idea
was <em>not to repress</em> my annoyance, impatience,
irritation, and inharmony, but to <em>displace them
with kindness and harmony</em>. Some of my first
attempts were most ludicrous and bordered on
the tragic but I kept at it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>The progress seemed so slow at first that
frequently I would be almost overwhelmed with
the thought of the impossibility of my ever
accomplishing the desired end but something
inside of me would again get hold of and urge
me on. In a couple of months’ time I could begin
to see some improvement, as there would
be some days when I would not have more than
half as many calls as usual. In six months’ time
I had done the work so well that days went by
when I did not have one single call which was
not for me.</p>

<p>All this occurred a number of years ago and
since then the calls which are not for me have
disappeared entirely and it is a rare instance
now for such a thing to occur.</p>

<p>This experience and its solution taught me
the lesson of “Who is to blame,” and since then
when anything has come into my life which was
at all inclined to be inharmonious in its effects,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
instead of blaming some one else for it I have
at once gotten busy with myself and created
more harmony in my own consciousness, and
through such creation have been able to displace
all inharmonious effects and transmute
them into “good” effects.
